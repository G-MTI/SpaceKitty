# Space Kitty

-Welcome to the Space Kitty repo!

-In this game, you’ll help Proxy, a lost space cat, escape from two planets and return safely to his spaceship.

## About
-Story: Proxy is a kitty who got separated from his spaceship while exploring space. Now he’s stuck on different planets and needs your help to get back home.

-Venus Level: Inspired by Venus, the Roman goddess of love. In this level, your goal is to collect hearts while navigating.

-Jupiter Level: Based on Zeus, the god of thunder and lightning. Here, you must avoid the lightning bolts to survive.

-Each level has a different mood, challenge, and mechanic to match the mythology behind the planet.

## How to use
-Use the arrow keys to move Proxy.

-Press Space to jump.

## Process
-This was our first time creating a game, so we decided to step out of our comfort zone and dive into something completely new.

-We had just 36 hours to learn the basics of game development, design the levels and mechanics, and turn everything into a playable experience.

-For tools, we used the Godot Engine to build the game and HTML/CSS to create a simple website to showcase it.

## Challenges
-Understanding how Godot works: nodes, scenes, signals, collisions (basically everything).

-We also spent a lot of time fixing bugs like collisions not working and the player not dying correctly.

-Another challenge was commiting and downloading the game.

## Learnings
-We (almost) learned how to build a small game from scratch and how to use Godot to create scenes, scripts and interactions.

-We also improved a lot in teamwork and in problem-solving under time pressure, becoming more confident with new tools and technologies.
